  Taint::tracking(project, taint_lines_file, single_test, $taint_output_file, log_file)

Run taint tracking for a provided project version.

F<taint_lines_file> is the name of a file that lists all source code lines which
should be tainted. C<single_test> is the name of the test method to run, format
of C<single_test> is <classname>::<methodname>. F<taint_output_file> is the name
of the file to where Flabug writes the list of source code lines that might be
faulty.

    @_ == 5 or die $ARG_ERROR;
    my ($project, $taint_lines_file, $single_test, $taint_output_file, $log_file) = @_;

        die "Flabug file ($taint_output_file) does not exist!";
