Slice.pm -- helper subroutines for dynamic slicing analysis.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides helper subroutines for dynamic slicing analysis using the
Java slicer tool developed by Clemens Hammacher at Saarland University.

=head2 Static subroutines

  Slice::tracing(project, single_test, trigger_test_log_file, trace_output_file, log_file)

Run tracing for a provided project version.

C<single_test> is the name of the test method to run, format of C<single_test>
is <classname>::<methodname>. F<trigger_test_log_file> is the name of the file
to where the stack trace of each test method is writen. F<trace_output_file> is
the name of the file to where dynamic backward tracing of each test method is
written.

=cut
sub tracing {
    @_ == 5 or die $ARG_ERROR;
    my ($project, $single_test, $trigger_test_log_file, $trace_output_file, $log_file) = @_;

    $project->dynamic_tracing($single_test, $trigger_test_log_file, $trace_output_file, $log_file)
        or die "Dynamic-tracing has failed for test case $single_test";
    if (! -e $trace_output_file) {
        system("cat $log_file");
        die "Trace output file ($trace_output_file) does not exist!";
    }

    return;
}

  Slice::slicing(project, loaded_classes_file, trigger_test_log_file, trace_output_file, slice_output_file, log_file)

Run slicing for a provided project version.

F<loaded_classes_file> is the name of the file with all loaded classes.
F<trigger_test_log_file> is the name of the file that contains the stack trace
of the trigger test method. F<slice_output_file> is the name of the file to
where slice of a previously computed trace F<trace_output_file> is written.
